Welcome To Forever Young Fitness!
\nIm glad you found you're way here. My name is Riccardo Washington and being a former college football player, and personal trainer in the southern California area I was able to learn alot of different things by working with so many people from so many backgrounds.
\nEverybody wants to look and feel their best but maybe don't know the steps to get there, or can't find a way to stay consistent long enough to get results.
\nThat's why I made this app, to help everyone look and feel their best so that you can be proof, age is just a number.
\nI like to always try and answer questions so don't hesitate to email or reach out on the fitness page @f.orevery.oungf.itness. Welcome to the Forever Young Family!
